  <h2>About us</h2>

  <p>We are an open network of University of Minnesota application developers looking to further our programming skills & capacity to innovate by meeting monthly to share tools & tricks of the trade via presentations, workshops, and facilitated discussions.</p>

  <h2>Who's behind this</h2>

  <p>The goals and activities of the Code-People group are managed by a small rotating group of programmers from different IT departments across campus.  We take turns planning, facilitating, contacting speakers, and developing presentations we hope the University programming community will find interesting and useful.  Given that our broader goal is to foster software collaboration, we hope to gradually expand these responsibilities as opportunities arise. Currently, we are:</p>
