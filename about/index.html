  <h2>About us</h2>

  <!-- <p>We are an open network of University of Minnesota application developers looking to further our programming skills & capacity to innovate by meeting monthly to share tools & tricks of the trade via presentations, workshops, and facilitated discussions.</p> -->
  
  <p>Our mission is to provide an open network for all members of the University of Minnesota tech community to share tools and practices to solve problems. We meet monthly to offer presentations and facilitate discussions. We also host trainings and social events.</p>

  <h2>Who's behind this</h2>

  <p>The goals and activities of the Code-People group are managed by a small rotating group of programmers from different IT departments across campus.  We take turns planning, facilitating, contacting speakers, and developing presentations we hope the University programming community will find interesting and useful.  Given that our broader goal is to foster software collaboration, we hope to gradually expand these responsibilities as opportunities arise. Currently, we are:</p>

  <ul>
      <li>Brian Hanson, College of Science and Engineering</li>
      <li>Kelsey Neis, College of Design</li>
      <li>Tonu Mikk, Disability Resource Center</li>
      <li>Travis Sobeck, Office of Information Technology</li>
      <li>Shawn Isenhart, Academic Support Resources
  </ul>

  <p>You can reach out to the steering committee by emailing code-people-committee@umn.edu</p>
  
  <h2>Get involved!</h2>

  <p>We gather on the first Thursday of every month, typically in Walter 402 from 9:30-11:00.
    If you can't make it but want to tune-in, we broadcast meetings in real-time with <a href="http://z.umn.edu/cpmstream">Zoom</a>.</p>
  <p>We discuss questions & topics relating to software development on a mailing list.
    Visit the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/umn.edu/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/code-people">Code People Google Group</a> to join the code-people@umn.edu mailing list.</p>
  <p>We are constantly looking for speakers and topic ideas for technical talks.
