  <h2>About us</h2>

  <p>We are an open network of University of Minnesota application developers looking to further our programming skills & capacity to innovate by meeting monthly to share tools & tricks of the trade via presentations, workshops, and facilitated discussions.</p>

  <h2>Who's behind this</h2>

  <p>The goals and activities of the Code-People group are managed by a small rotating group of programmers from different IT departments across campus.  We take turns planning, facilitating, contacting speakers, and developing presentations we hope the University programming community will find interesting and useful.  Given that our broader goal is to foster software collaboration, we hope to gradually expand these responsibilities as opportunities arise. Currently, we are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Brian Hanson, Digital Technology Center</li>
    <li>Paul Rubenis, Office of Information Technology</li>
    <li>Chris Crosby-Schmidt, Office of Information Technology</li>
    <li>David Naughton, University Libraries</li>
    <li>Jack Brown, Office of Information Technology</li>
    <li>Chris Dinger, Office of Information Technology</li>
    <li>Kim Doberstein, Academic Support Resources</li>
    <li>Ian Whitney, Academic Support Resources</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Get involved!</h2>

    <p>We gather on the first Thursday of every month, typically in Walter 402 from 9:30-11:00.
    If you can't make it but want to tune-in, we broadcast meetings in real-time with <a href="https://umconnect.umn.edu/cpm">UMConnect</a>.</p>
    <p>We discuss technical questions & topics relating to software development on a mailing list.
    Visit the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/umn.edu/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/code-people">Code People Google Group</a> to join the code-people@umn.edu mailing list.</p>
    <p>We are constantly looking for speakers and topic ideas for technical talks.
    Please email <a href="mailto:code-people-committee@umn.edu">code-people-committee@umn.edu</a> with your ideas.</p>
  </ul>
