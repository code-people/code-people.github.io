  <h2>Speaker Guidelines</h2>

  <p>Scheduled to give a talk at an upcoming Code People meeting? Great! We're excited to learn from you.</p>

  <p>We strongly prefer presentations that are available via a public URL, like <a href="https://www.google.com/slides/about">Google Slides</a>.<br>If you must present using your own laptop, here is a list of things to check to make sure your talk goes as smooth as possible!</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Install WebEx
      <ul>
          <li>You can get the browser plugin <a href="https://umn.webex.com">here</a></li>
          <li>Or you can join the Code People webex, which will be listed on the meeting on our site. Your browser should prompt you to install the plugin.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Turn off your desktop notifications</li>
    <li>Make sure your laptop can connect to our displays.<br>
      The following connections are available for you to use. If your laptop uses USB-C or some other connection, make sure you bring the appropriate adapter.
      <ul>
          <li>VGA</li>
          <li>HDMI</li>
          <li>Thunderbolt</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure your laptop is charged.</li>
    <li>If possible, connect to the network via ethernet.</li>
