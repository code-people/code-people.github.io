  <h2>Presenter Guidelines</h2>

  <p>Scheduled to give a talk at an upcoming Code People meeting? Great! We're excited to learn from you.</p>

  <p>We strongly prefer presentations that are available via a public URL, like <a href="https://www.google.com/slides/about">Google Slides</a>.</p>

<p>We provide a computer with everything set up for the presentation. If you must present using your own laptop, here is a list of things to check to make sure your talk goes as smooth as possible!</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://it.umn.edu/technology/zoom">Install Zoom</a></li>
    <li>The presentation link is <a href="https://z.umn.edu/cpmstream">z.umn.edu/cpmstream</a></li>
    <li>Turn off your desktop notifications</li>
    <li>Make sure your laptop can connect to our displays.<br>
      The following connections are available for you to use. If your laptop uses USB-C or some other connection, make sure you bring the appropriate adapter.
      <ul>
          <li>VGA</li>
          <li>HDMI</li>
          <li>Thunderbolt</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Make sure your laptop is charged.</li>
    <li>If possible, connect to the network via ethernet.</li>
  </ol>

    <h3>Lightning talks</h3>

    <p>Lightning talks are very short, informal presentations about a specific topic. These are usually given after the other talks at each Code People meeting.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You don't need to have anything formal prepared. If you want to just plug an upcoming event or mention a useful web tool, that's good enough for us!</li>
        <li>If you do have slides prepared, they should accessible on any computer (see above about Google Slides).</li>
        <li>Demos are not recommended. If you have demos, they should be available online for others to poke at.</li>
        <li>Your talk should be 5 minutes at the maximum. We will be timing you to make sure others have enough time to give their lightning talks.</li>
    </ul>

<h3>How It Works talks</h3>
  <p>How IT Works talks are 10-15 minutes in length and are created using a common template.  These talks are well suited for presenting about an application or a website as a complete package with an eye towards describing how it was built.  The Google slideshow template  helps someone to put a presentation together with less effort.  Please make a copy of the template and fill in the necessary slots for your application. </p>
