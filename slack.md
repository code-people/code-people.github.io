All the tech-related Communities of Practice gather at [http://tech-people-umn.slack.com/](http://tech-people-umn.slack.com/ Slack). We would love to have you join us.

- Go to [https://tech-people-umn.slack.com/signup](https://tech-people-umn.slack.com/signup)
- Enter your umn.edu email address
- Click _Create Account_
- Follow the instructions in the email you receive from Slack

Don't have a umn.edu email address? Maybe because of the weird way the U set up Google for system campuses? Email whit0694@umn.edu and we'll get you an invite right away.

Once you've joined, introduce yourself in #general and then join us in the #code_people channel.
