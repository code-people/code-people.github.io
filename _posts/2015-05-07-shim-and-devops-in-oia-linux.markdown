For the May DevOps/Code People Meeting!

We have two all-star presenters that will be talking this month!

First, Mike Reeves (OIT Custom Solutions) will be talking about _IDM's Shim_:

> The Shim is our new solution to move identity information between
> Peoplesoft data and X.500. The ESUP IdM team will discuss the
> current state for these processes, technologies being used,
> the new tool, and walk us through an example. Join us to learn
> about this critical business process, and gain a better
> understanding of how we handle identities."

Then, Shawn Houston (OIT Linux) will be talking about: _Infrastructure as Code: More Than Tools
How OIA Linux is Bringing DevOps Principles to Automation_

> OIT's OIA Linux group is bringing system automation through Chef
> cookbooks to OIT Hosting. Throughout the process DevOps
> principles have been incorporated into the cookbook design
> allowing automation to follow service, and for customers to
> gain powerful access to the features of the OS they need to
> manipulate without requiring deep knowledge of the OS itself."

### Lunch on the Plaza?

We'll be walking over by the McNamara Alumni Center, grabbing lunch wherever
you fancy nearby (or bringing from home), and having a picnic, assuming the
weather is nice!

We also hope to have a couple of Lightning talks at this event!
If you have any ideas for a quick (5 minute or less) informal
talk, please let us know at [code-people-committee@umn.edu](code-people-committee@umn.edu)
or [devops-committee@umn.edu](devops-committee@umn.edu).

### First meeting on WebEx

Finally, the May event will be the first event recorded using WebEx
instead of UM Connect. We'll be sending out more information
soon on how to connect via WebEx!
