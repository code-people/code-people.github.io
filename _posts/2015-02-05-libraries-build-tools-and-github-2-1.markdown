Selamat siang, Code People!

Due to the change of ESUP timelines, we will be actually having our regularly scheduled meeting this month, and let me tell you, it is action packed! We have the following speakers this month:

- Eric Larson (Libraries) will be talking about their website theme build process, which is
  an interesting toolchain assembled from middleman, bower, and other neat toys!

- Jake Gage (OIT Custom Solutions) will be introducing us to github 2.1, and all of the new features that will be coming in the near future!

- Additionally, we'll be having one more, as to be announced, super not-so-secret speaker. Or more Lightning Talks.

And of course, there will be time for Lightning Talks! Always exciting, new fun stuff! Code Peoples talking about what they are excited about, with a hard 5 minute time limit!
