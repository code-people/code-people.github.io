## Interacting with PeopleSoft

The first talk will be led by Jeremy Irrthum (OIT PeopleSoft
Solutions) and Jack Brown (OIT Custom Solutions). The topic of
their discussion will be interacting with PeopleSoft.
PeopleSoft, for many of us around the University, has been a
mystical “black box”, so we’ll try demystify it somewhat!

Next, the API@UMN group will demonstrate code and report on the
tremendous progress they have made since Campus Codefest.

Finally, time permitting, Jack Brown will demonstrate creating a JAX-WS
web service (in 15 minutes or less).

As always, we’ll have a little time for lightning talks.
Remember, these talks are a maximum of five minutes and don’t
require slides. Don’t be shy, we don’t bite!

Everyone should feel free to join us for lunch at 11:00 (after
the meeting).
