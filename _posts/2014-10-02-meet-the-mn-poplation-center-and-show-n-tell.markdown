Another month approaches, Code-People!

We're starting a new series of presentations this month, Meet a Development Group! This month will learn about the developers at the Minnesota Population Center, what they do and how they do it.

After that, we'll learn about the new Queue Management System that the ASR Web Team wrote for One Stop Student Services.

Ingrid Nuttall, Director of Student Records, will be presenting about the Course Guide and ESUP.  This has been a hot topic on the mailing list this week! She'll be speaking during the Lightning Talks time.

Then, lightning talks. 2-3 quick talks about fun topics.

As always, feel free to join us for lunch following the talks, even if you do not come to the meeting.
