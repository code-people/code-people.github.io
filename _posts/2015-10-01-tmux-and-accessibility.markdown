Sugeng énjing, Code People!

Please join us on Thursday, October 1, for another action-packed episode of Code-People!

### Lightning talks

We're trying to be more intentional about pestering you all to come up and share with the group. Want to show-n-tell a cool project you're working on? Found a new cool way to deal with an old issue? Are you experimenting with a new language or framework? Spend a few minutes talking about it! It's super informal (you can wing it if you want!) and it *has* to be less than five minutes, so the commitment is small.

### Donuts!!!

Also, Ian will be bringing a pile of donuts from Sssdude-Nutz in Dinkytown—come early and enjoy one!

### Agenda

- 9:30-9:35 - Welcome and announcements (Chris Dinger)
- 9:35-9:45 - Upcoming Oracle DB changes (Andy Wattenhofer)
- 9:45-10:00 - tmux overview (Michael Berkowski)
- 10:00-10:30 - Accessibility info for coders (Kim Doberstein)
- 10:30-10:45 - RedHat 7 progress report (Ben Larson)
- 10:45-11:00 - Lightning talks (this is YOU!)

This month we'll be heading over to Surly Brewing for lunch after the meeting.

I hope to see you all there!
