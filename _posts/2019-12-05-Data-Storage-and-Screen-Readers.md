## Talk Descriptions:

### Data Storage
Fred Dulles and Jill Woyak - UMN Storage Champion Network 
> We will cover current and upcoming UMN storage options as well as the future of the files.umn.edu (aka Isilon) server. We will also cover the Storage Champion Network, a newly started effort to bring together storage experts from throughout the five campuses of the University. The SCN is a mutually supportive network of experts (both in and out of OIT) which will help users in research and otherwise to navigate the exciting and ever changing world of data storage.

### Screen Reader Testing
Khaled Musa - Academic Technology Support Services
> Let's face it: screen reader testing is cumbersome. Without comprehensive training (as well as expert level knowledge) of a desktop screen reader, the process of performing manual screen reader compatibility tests can be daunting and often riddled with headaches and missteps. Join Khaled Musa from ATSS as he shows you how to make the best of a screen reader testing (Voiceover on the Mac, Jaws or NVDA on Windows). This short session will cover the most common errors and demonstrate a live demo of Jaws.
