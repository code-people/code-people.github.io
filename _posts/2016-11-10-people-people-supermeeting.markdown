Gather round, Web People, Net People, DevOps, Code People, Comp-Sec, and other people for the first Tech People Meeting!

On Thursday, November 10, Walter Library 402, we will convene our first twice-annual super-group meeting of iCoPs. We've chosen talks that should be of interest to all, and in the rare case something isn't interesting, we'll have a huge amount of refreshments to keep you occupied.

Talks begin at 9:30, but please show up early for some social time. The most valuable thing you can do is meet people from the other groups.

So that we're sure we'll have enough treats for all, [please RSVP](https://goo.gl/forms/Xpu5P7hZ5f1a7YJn1)

 - 9:00  Social Hangout with Coffee, Donuts, Cookies
 - 9:30  Standup Meetings, Discussion and Ideas - Panel
 - 9:50  What Is DevOps? And Why Devops?, Marisa Brandt (Senior Manager, Platforms)
