Location\: [Walter Library](http://campusmaps.umn.edu/tc/map.php?building=042), Room 402

Our meeting will begin with a brief, but powerful, submit-to-Campus-Codefest sermon by [Michael Berkowski](mailto:mjb@umn.edu). Once we’re fired up, [Joe Ardolino](mailto:ardol004@umn.edu) will pour on the gasoline with a dazzling demonstration of the Qualys web application scanner. Next, [Eric Fournier](mailto:emf@umn.edu) will bring the house down with a mind-melting technical analysis of Salesforce. Finally, we’ll cool down with a discussion of enterprise data needs, as [David Imdieke](mailto:imdie001@umn.edu), [Travis Noll](mailto:tjn@umn.edu), [John Colosey](mailto:colos006@umn.edu), and [Kemal Badur](mailto:kemal@umn.edu) ask, "What do you want exposed from PeopleSoft"?

We usually have time for lightning talks at the end, so come prepared to share something scintillating!

As always, feel free to join us for lunch following the talks, even if you do not come to the meeting.
