Location\: [Walter Library](http://campusmaps.umn.edu/tc/map.php?building=042), Room 402

Our meeting will begin with a brief, but powerful, submit-to-[Campus-Codefest](http://apps.oir.umn.edu/campus_codefest) sermon by [Michael Berkowski](mailto:mjb@umn.edu), who will also open the floor to anyone who wants feedback on a project idea. Once weâ€™re fired up, [Joe Ardolino](mailto:ardol004@umn.edu) will pour on the gasoline with a dazzling demonstration of the [Qualys](https://www.qualys.com/) web application scanner. Next, [Eric Fournier](mailto:emf@umn.edu) will bring the house down with a mind-melting technical analysis of [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/).

We usually have time for lightning talks at the end, so come prepared to share something scintillating!

As always, feel free to join us for lunch following the talks, even if you do not come to the meeting.
