Good Day Code Peoples and DevOpsers!

In an effort to be more proactive, we are sending out our agenda
far ahead of our planned meeting, so that you all can plan
around it. We are committing to keeping to this (of course,
expect the unexpected) so that it will be easier for you to
plan around.

### Tentative agenda

- 9:30-10:00: Testing Infrastructure
- 10:00-10:15: CCF Q&A
- 10:15-10:45: PHP Database APIs Today
- 10:45-11:00: Lightning Talks

Lunch will be at Burrito Loco!

For those of you that are interested - we will be hosting a
training session with Sandi Metz (Practical Object-Oriented
Design in Ruby) the last week in January. If you are
interested, please let us know ASAP. Kemal Badur (kemal@umn.edu)
will be handling the logistics on this.

Have a great day, and we hope to see you next month! Stay tuned for
some exciting news on "brown bag" lunches to discuss some of
the topics that came out of our consensus workshop, as well as
some potential "deep dives".

Planned upcoming "brown bag" sessions:

- Apache configuration
- DevOps cookbook delves
- Accessibility and UI
- others?
