Afternoon, Code People!

Sad news, we are cancelling our September meeting because our presenters got pulled into last-minute....things. Things!

However, lunch still seems like a nice plan. Everyone likes lunch! We'll meet at Stub & Herb's at 11:30 to grab food and beverages. Join us!

When we have the October itinerary, we'll send it out to y'all.
