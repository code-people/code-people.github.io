## Intro to Groovy

Our meeting will begin with an an Intro to the Groovy programming language by a
local Groovy pro, Doug Sabers. Doug is a Principal Consultant at Object
Partners Inc with over 13 years of development experience. He has been working
with Groovy and/or Grails for the last five years. He helps run the [Groovy Users
of MN group](http://www.groovy.mn) and two local technology conferences,
[Gr8conf.us](Gr8conf.us) and [MidwestJS](http://www.midwestjs.com).

Please ping Doug at: [@lightsabersd](https://twitter.com/lightsabersd) and/or [github.com/sabersd](http://www.github.com/sabersd).

## PeopleSoft services

At our last meeting, we learned how the PeopleSoft team queries PeopleSoft data
and about their interest in wrapping common PeopleSoft requests within a web
services layer. We thought it would be fun and interesting as a group to model
some common requests. Kim Doberstein (our latest and clearly greatest
Code-People Steering Committee member) will facilitate this discussion.

If we have time, we’ll also squeeze in a lightning talk or two. So, come
prepared to share something with the group.

As always, if you can’t make the session, feel free to join us for lunch
following the talks.
