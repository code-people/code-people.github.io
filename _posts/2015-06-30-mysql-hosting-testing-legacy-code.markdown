The July meeting will not be our "usual" happy hour, since we've
had a few of these as of late (that isn't to say we couldn't
do a happy hour as well!). We'll be meeting on Tuesday,
June 30 (I know it isn't technically July, but it's the best we could do).

### Tentative agenda
- 15 min: MySQL Hosting (MJB contact Jeff Aspinall)
- 15 min: How do you start automating testing in legacy code?  (Chris D, Jack)
- 30 min: Consensus workshop?  Ops subject (testing in Chef - Test Kitchen, rspec)
- Peoplesoft team (meet a dev group)
- Lightning talks (subject to change)

Have a great day, and we hope to see you next month! Stay tuned for
some exciting news on "brown bag" lunches to discuss some of
the topics that came out of our consensus workshop, as well as
some potential "deep dives".
