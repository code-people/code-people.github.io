### Development Environment Discussion

With the multiple discussions on tech people slack about docker desktop licensing,
it seemed like a good time to talk about development environments. Some ideas to
think about:

How do you manage your development enviroment and project dependencies?

How did you handle the changes to docker desktop licensing?
- pay for a license
- become an instructor
- switch to podman or something else 
- spin up your own kubernetes cluster
- revel in the schadenfreude of not using containers
