### Open Discussion: Professional Development

>People in Information Technology professions are constantly needing to learn new technologies, adapt to changing environments and implement better practices.  How are you managing to include professional development in your work?  How have the professional development opportunities changed for you since we began working from home?  These questions and others will be our prompts for discussion in small groups.
