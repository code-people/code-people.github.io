## Talk Descriptions:

### Database Indexes
Brad Carlson - OIT Database Hosting

> Indexes. Why use them? How should I use them? How should I _not_ use them? We'll cover these questions along with some database and platform specific concerns.

### Building a VueJS Front End
Travis Sobeck - OIT Virt/Infrastructure

> I'll demo a front-end written in Vuejs for custom API. We'll also discuss using google oauth and the CI-CD pipeline to build and deploy it to Kubernetes.
