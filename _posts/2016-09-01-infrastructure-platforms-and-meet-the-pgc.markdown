Our September meeting is as early as it can be in September. It's certainly taken
me by surprise. This month we'll be talking a lot about infrastructure - the VMs
we use and how to configure them.

And we'll get to meet the Polar Geospatial Center development team, who uses a
lot of infrastructure in cool ways.

We hope to see you there!
