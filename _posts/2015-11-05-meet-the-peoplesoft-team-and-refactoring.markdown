Good afternoon everyone,

In an effort to be more proactive, we are sending out our agenda far ahead of our planned meeting, so that you all can plan around it. We are committing to keeping to this (of course, expect the unexpected) so that it will be easier for you to plan around.

### Tentative agenda

- 9:30-10:00:	Meet a Development Group: PeopleSoft (Jeremy Irrthum)
- 10:00-10:15:	GitHub Announcements (Jake Gage)
- 10:15-10:35:	Practicing Refactoring (Ian Whitney)
- 10:35-11:00:	Lightning talks
  - Progress on institutional CI (Jake)
  - Overcommit (Debbie)
  - A talk on Lightning Talks
  - Bring your ideas!

We are planning for lunch at Burrito Loco, and we'll post it on the whiteboard during the meeting.
