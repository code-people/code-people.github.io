We are pleased to announce the return of [Campus Codefest](https://tech-people.umn.edu/campus-codefest-2023) on its ten year anniversary!

Campus Codefest 2023 will be held August 17 (Thursday) and 18 (Friday) at the [Collaboration Studio in Wilson Library](https://www.lib.umn.edu/spaces/list/wilson-research-collaboration-studio)  from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.  [Sign up here!](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeNkWKqYPFkw5g1R0RNlaTiFktNaeWxUEGwC9LyfKiycdbJ9Q/viewform)

The purpose of Codefest is to gather IT professionals (or amateurs!) who have an interest in coding and coding-adjacent topics to get together and hack on stuff.  

The format is very flexible - topics are collected both in advance in slack and the day of, and people self-select a topic they are interested in.  People can switch between topics if they want.  At the end of the second day, each topic group does a brief presentation to show off what they worked on and learned.  Some projects target specific needs that someone wants to address, like an API for determining the current term, others are designed around exploring a tool or technology, like learning JavaScript or React, and some are just for fun, like building and programming mini robots!

Please post project ideas in Tech People slack in the #ccf-projects channel, or check out the channel to see what projects you might be interested in working on.  Some examples of previous CCF projects include:
- An API aggregator
- Intro to Javascript
- Google Maps mashup
- The terms.umn.edu service
- Exploring VR

All are welcome!  You can learn more about [Campus Codefest here](https://tech-people.umn.edu/campus-codefest-2023).  We look forward to seeing you!
