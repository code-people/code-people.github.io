Konbanwa, code peeps!

It's November already, which means it's time for the next edition of Code-People.

This month our dev group spotlight shines on Kendrick Erickson and the CLA Student Services development team. Kendrick will talk about the team, how they operate, and will highlight some of their coolest software.

Debbie Gillespie will then share some advanced Git tricks. She'll highlight different Git workflows and when to use them. We'll also hear about Github Pull Requests and how to get the most out of them.

After that, YOU'RE UP! We'll have plenty of time for lightning talks, so come share an interesting thing you recently learned, a new tool you've discovered, orâ€”anything! No slides or preparation required here, folks.

### Schedule

As always, feel free to join us for lunch following the talks even if you do not come to the meeting.
