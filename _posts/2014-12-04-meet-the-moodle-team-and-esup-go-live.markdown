Buna ziua, Cod Oameni!

Our next Code People meeting is upon us! Here's the agenda for Thursday, 12/4:

- Dev group spotlight: OIT Academic Tools - Jeff Kerzner and Dom Hanzely will give us a glimpse of life in Moodleland.
- [Postponed] ESUP Go Live events - John Colosey, OIT's development manager for ESUP, will talk about what's planned for the much-anticipated week of 2/15/15.
- Lightning talks

As always, everyone is welcome to get lunch together to continue the conversation.

A couple of additional notes:

- The Code People committee is looking for fresh blood! If you're interested in helping (to try and) steer this merry band of misfits, drop a line to anyone on the committee.
- As is our tradition, January's meeting will be a happy hour, and will be on 1/8, NOT 1/1. Plan accordingly! More details to come.

### Schedule

- 9:30 - 10:00 - Meet the Moodle development team
