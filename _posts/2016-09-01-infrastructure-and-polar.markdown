Location: [Walter Library](http://campusmaps.umn.edu/tc/map.php?building=042), Room 402

Our September meeting is as early as it can be in September. It's certainly taken me by surprise. This month we'll be talking a lot about infrastructure - the VMs we use and how to configure them.

And we'll get to meet the Polar Geospatial Center development team, who uses a lot of infrastructure in cool ways.

We hope to see you there!
