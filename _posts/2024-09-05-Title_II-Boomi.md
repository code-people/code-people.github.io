### Road to Accessibility: the New DOJ Title II and the U 
Join members of the Office for Digital Accessibility (ODA) for an overview of the new ADA Title II rule changes and their implications for the University community.
If you manage or edit a website for the university, are working with Canvas courses, or work on public communication, we have until April 2026 to make sure all 
digital content complies with the Web Content Access Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standard. This presentation will go over what types of content are included and what are the exceptions.
Most importantly, we will share what the university has done in preparation to date and what we are doing to meet the compliance deadline. We will also share recommendations and resources, 
including Pope Tech and Editoria11y, to help you raise awareness in your college or department.
