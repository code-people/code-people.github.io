Bjarne Stroustrup observed,

> There are only two kinds of programming languages: those people always bitch about and those nobody uses.

No question that PHP is the first kind. What other language is both more commonly-used and commonly-maligned? Yet many who use it and complain about it seem unaware of how dramatically PHP has changed for the better over its long history. To help bring our understanding of PHP into the 21st century, David Naughton will give an overview of the state of the PHP art, including both core language features and community-contributed projects.

Michael Berkowski will provide an update of the Community Shibboleth API project which began at Campus Code Fest, and the structure of the Github organization created to guide participation and code contributions. (https://github.umn.edu/organizations/umn-community-shib)
