### Priorities and Directions for the Coming Year

We have a number of directions in which we could take Code People: hands-on workshops (e.g. more on shibboleth); technical talks on your favorite language or tool; code sprints (work together on U of M projects); strut your stuff and demo your work; Campus Codefest “where are they now” project reports; and lots more. Come help set our priorities for the coming academic year in this brainstorming session.

- 10:00 am - 10:30 am - Small Group Discussions
