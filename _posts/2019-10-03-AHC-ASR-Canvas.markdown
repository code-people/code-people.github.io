## Talk Descriptions:

### Meet the HST Dev Group
HST Development and Integrations Team

> Meet the Health Sciences Technology (HST) Development and Integrations team. We'll talk about how our organization fits into the University, what kind of work we do, and show off a couple of recent projects.

### Working with External Data and Events
Ian Whitney - ASR

> ASR uses a lot of external applications. Over the years we've developed multiple approaches to effectively work with data and events from these applications. In this talk I'll discuss our approaches, their pros and cons and a possible future solutions using Apache Kafka.

### Enhancing Learning and Measuring Educational Outcomes with Learning Management System Integrations
Drew LaChapelle and Chris Scruton - OIT Academic Technology

> Canvas, the University's learning-management system (LMS), provides a hub for managing online learning offerings, content, and activities. In this presentation, we will provide an overview of the LMS. We will also describe opportunities to extend, enhance, or manage students' learning experiences, and options to aggregate/report on learning behaviors and outcomes using integrations. We will briefly cover the capabilities and limitations of available integration methods, as well as relevant data standards and governance procedures.
