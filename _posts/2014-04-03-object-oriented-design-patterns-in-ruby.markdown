## Object Oriented Design

Ian Whitney will demonstrate (Live! On Stage!) OOD and refactoring techniques
he recently learned from Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen. Learn how to avoid your
own worst tendencies and design excellent code even when the requirements are
unknown. And are requirements ever truly known?

## Web application security discussion

Bob Alberti, security architect with UIS, will briefly discuss steps to help
improve application security risk, including the OWASP Top Ten and security's
place in the SDLC.

## Schedule (tentative)

- 9:30-10:00: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby
- 10:00-10:25: Web app security discussion
- 10:25-11:00: Lightning talks (that's you!!!)

As usual, many of us will head straight to lunch after the meeting to continue
our discussions and to network. Join us!
