## OO Ruby patterns

Ian Whitney is spending a week in Durhan, NC with [Sandi Metz](http://www.sandimetz.com/)
learning how to build rock-solid, maintainable systems in Ruby and is willing
to share his learnings with the community (hear that, dev-ops folks?). Sandi literally
[wrote the book](http://www.informit.com/store/practical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby-an-agile-primer-9780321721334)
on this subject, so prepare yourself for lots of useful knowledge nuggets!

## Web application security discussion

Bob Alberti, security architect with UIS, will briefly discuss steps to help
improve application security risk, including the OWASP Top Ten and security's
place in the SDLC.

## Schedule (tentative)

- 9:30-10:00: Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby
- 10:00-10:25: Web app security discussion
- 10:25-11:00: Lightning talks (that's you!!!)

As usual, many of us will head straight to lunch after the meeting to continue
our discussions and to network. Join us!
