### 9:30 am - 10:45 am
The speaker this coming week is you. We’ll have a round of “World Domination” talks where you’ll have a chance to get early feedback on your Campus Codefest 2013 project idea(s). These talks will be short (5-10 minutes) with a few minutes of feedback and discussion after each one. If you want to make slides, that’s fine, but it is not at all required.

### 10:45 am - 11:00 am
We have a plan for this camp, and since it’s ultimately your camp, we’d like your feedback on how to make this camp even better. Help us make sure everybody has a fun and maybe even productive (but absolutely definitely fun) time at the event.

Specific Issues to consider:

- Too Few Projects
- Too Many Projects
- Similar Projects
- Team Dynamics
- We'll have coaches on-hand for help
