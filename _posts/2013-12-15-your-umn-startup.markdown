Featuring Justin Porter from the Office of Technology Commercialization. Justin asks:

> Are you interested in start-up companies? Do you want to start a technology-based company? Come learn about start-up companies based on UMN technologies and how to start a high-tech company from the Office for Technology Commercialization Venture Center

Chris Ghere will also be on hand to answer questions about open sourcing your code (a follow-up to a talk he gave this past October) and will have more resources to share on that topic.

As always, we’ll have a little time for lightning talks. Remember, these talks are a maximum of five minutes and don’t require slides. Don’t be shy, we don’t bite!
