## Talk Descriptions:

### Creating Public Documentation with VuePress
Colin McFadden - CLA LATIS 
> VuePress allows you to create easy-to-navigate, SEO-friendly documentation using markdown, which can be hosted through GitHub Pages.  This allows your documentation to exist within your GitHub repo and allows for crowd-sourcing documentation.    In this presentation, weâ€™ll look at the pros and cons of VuePress, and walk through the process for creating new documentation.

### My Year as a Tech Lead
Tony Thomas - Academic Support Resources
> What does "Tech Lead" mean? It's a vague title and definitions vary.

> I spent a year as the tech lead on a project and I was asked to define what I thought that role meant. This talk would focus on lessons learned during that year. I'll tell the story of what I think my role as tech lead was and draw on books and resources I found helpful along the way.

### Database Indexes
Brad Carlson - OIT
> Why use them? How to figure out which columns to index? Database and platform specific concerns "gotcha"s, anti-patterns, or things to avoid.
